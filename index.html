            <h1>Marvel's Adversaries</h1>
            <p>Captain Marvel's arch enemy was the mad scientist <a href="#">Doctor Sivana</a>,
               who regularly plotted elaborate schemes to rule the world and defeat both
               Captain Marvel and America.
               Sivana had four children who also had prominent roles in Captain Marvel's adventures.
               Two evil children, Georgia and Sivana, Jr., resembled their father both physically
               and in their desire to conquer the Earth. Sivana's daughter Beautia however, loved
               Captain Marvel and Sivana's son, Magnificus, was also a sometime-ally of the
               Captain.</p>
            <p>Marvel's other adversaries included <a href="#">Captain Nazi</a> and a nuclear-powered
               robot named <a href="#">Mister Atom</a>. Matching Captain Marvel's adopted power from
               ancient heroes was <a href="#">Ibac</a>, an evil magician who gained his power from
               the ancient villians <strong>I</strong>van the Terrible, Cesare <strong>B</strong>orgia,
               <strong>A</strong>ttila the Hun, and <strong>C</strong>aligula.</p>
            <p>One of the more popular serials in the Fawcett Comics run of Captain Marvel adventures
               was the <a href="#">Monster Society of Evil</a> story arc which involved several
               of Marvel's adversaries from previous issues, including Doctor Sivana, Captain Nazi,
               and Ibac. The society was led by the cunning <a href="#">Mister Mind</a>, a character who was
               eventually revealed to be a highly intelligent worm from another planet.</p>
